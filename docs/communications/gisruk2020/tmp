Summary
The sensitivity analysis and validation of simulation models require specific approaches in the case of spatial models. We describe a scala library providing such tools, including synthetic generators for urban configurations at different scales, spatial networks, and spatial point pro- cesses. These can be used to parametrize geosimulation models on synthetic configurations, and evaluate the sensitivity of model outcomes to spatial configuration. The library also includes methods to perturbate real data, and spatial statistics indicators, urban form indicators, and network indicators. It is embedded into the OpenMOLE platform for model exploration, foster- ing the application of such methods without technical constraints.
KEYWORDS: Sensitivity analysis; Geosimulation; Spatial synthetic data; Model validation; Model exploration.
1 Introduction
Openshaw (1984)
Kwan (2012)
In the case of Land-use Transport interaction models, Thomas et al. (2018) show how the de- lineation of the urban area can significantly impact simulation outcomes. Banos (2012) studies the Schelling segregation model on networks, and shows that network structure strongly influences model behavior.

3 Applications
Different applications of the library have already been described in the literature. Regarding the generation of synthetic data in itself,
