The sensitivity analysis and validation of simulation models require specific approaches in the case of spatial models. We describe a scala library providing such tools, including synthetic generators for urban configurations at different scales, spatial networks, and spatial point processes. These can be used to parametrize geosimulation models on synthetic configurations, and evaluate the sensitivity of model outcomes to spatial configuration. The library also includes methods to perturbate real data, and spatial statistics indicators, urban form indicators, and network indicators. It is embedded into the OpenMOLE platform for model exploration, fostering the application of such methods without technical constraints.

\section{Introduction}


The sensitivity of geographical analyses to the spatial structure of data is well known since the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem was put forward by \cite{openshaw1984modifiable}. This type of issue has been generalized to various aspects since, including temporal granularity \citep{cheng2014modifiable} or the geographical context more generally \citep{kwan2012uncertain}. When studying geosimulation models \citep{benenson2004geosimulation}, similar issues must be taken into account, extending classical sensitivity analysis methods \citep{saltelli2004sensitivity} to what can be understood as \emph{Spatial Sensitivity Analysis} as proposed by \cite{raimbault2019space}.

Several studies showed the importance of that approach. For example, in the case of Land-use Transport interaction models, \cite{thomas2018city} show how the delineation of the urban area can significantly impact simulation outcomes. \cite{banos2012network} studies the Schelling segregation model on networks, and shows that network structure strongly influences model behavior. The spatial resolution in raster configurations can also change results \citep{singh2007schelling}.

On the other hand, the use of spatial synthetic data generation is generally bound to model parametrization without a particular focus on sensitivity analysis, such as in microsimulation models \citep{smith2009improving}, spatialized social networks \citep{barrett2009generation}, or
